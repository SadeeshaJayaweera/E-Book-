                    ticket some failures can occur as there are some fakes sites which don’t provide tickets by taking
                    users
                    money.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">Almost everyone in this world listens to music they like in their leisure hours.
                    Sociologist’s state that “listening to music will reduce people's stress.” When comparing with past
                    years most of the people listened to many songs but it is not much compared with today's society. I
                    also
                    listen to music while solving mathematical problems because it is easy for me to concentrate on the
                    work. Majority of programmers in the global listen to “Techno beats” whilst they coding. As a
                    result,
                    music helps us in many ways.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">People can listen to music in many ways in the present world rather than limiting to
                    CDs
                    or DVDs. There are many websites that provide music to people for free. But in earlier, musician
                    earned
                    money by issuing an album to their fans. Nowadays people download songs that they want legally or
                    illegally. Legally download not cost money most of the time. Therefore, the majority of people tend
                    to
                    download music from the internet rather than purchasing music album CDS by paying a high amount of
                    money.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">“61% of people who buy CDs are 36 and older, according to Music Watch’s estimate. Ten
                    years ago, that figure was just 36%. Back in 2004, people over 50 made up just 19% of the CD-buying
                    population, but today they’re more than a third.” (statistics taken from “altpress.com”)

                <p align="justify">“As a group, 13 to 17-year-olds have plummeted to a mere 7% of the CD-buying
                    population,
                    down from 14.9% in 2004. Their share of digital purchases, either singles or albums, is also down a
                    healthy 12 percentage points — to just 13% — as downloading has become more mainstream among older
                    demographics.” (statistics taken from “altpress.com”)
