                <p align="justify">Indeed, ICT has affected this mentioned two arenas in a mesmerizing way than it has
                    influenced any other sector with its hands. When reflecting the time before the revolution in ICT,
                    there
                    were music, movies, and games which were indeed limited for a specific domain and limited in
                    quantity.
                    But with the influence of ICT, the entertainment industry has discovered its loophole on getting
                    access
                    to its audience. </p>

                <p align="justify">In early decades’ people went to Drama shoes and music shoes to entertain themselves.
                    But
                    in the present years, there are many entertainment sources like Film shows, Gaming competitions,
                    etc.
                    Nowadays the majority of people visiting film halls to have fun. However, when it comes to cinema
                    many
                    changes been happened due to the revolution of ICT. As a result, Cinema industry technology upgraded
                    from Regular (2D) to new (3D) with a lot of qualities compared with the regular film industry. Most
                    of
                    the families going to watch movies in their leisure time even they busy. I think we can relax our
                    minds
                    by watching movies in my opinion. Online ticketing services like “Q-Tickets” are available for the
                    people so it helps users to purchase a large number of tickets from their comfort zone. </p>

                <p align="justify">However, watching movies is not limited to cinema halls since a movie is only
                    available
                    for a few months at the cinema. Once it is over we can download movies from websites like “Jiffy
                    Torrents” for free of charge. This is a good benefit for busy people and people those who don’t like
                    to
                    go anywhere and watch movies. In my opinion, it is easy to and saves our money if we watch movies by
                    downloading them rather than visiting cinema halls. I have downloaded many films from the internet
                    both
                    3D and 2D it Is easy and anyone can do it. </p>
