                <h2>Working Styles</h2>

                <p align="justify">ICT has affected human life in an extreme way when it comes to the working world. The
                    way
                    of handling office work can be emphasized as the best example, which can be comparatively studied
                    with
                    the previous century. </p>

                <p align="justify">When reflecting the past of forty years before, the offices were filled up with
                    mountains
                    of files with plenty of documents, which should be analysed with the human brain power with a firm
                    effort. But now, in the present day working environment, someone would barely see a desk like that.
                    Instead of a view of a well-organized desk with nothing; but a laptop, or a tab, or perhaps barely a
                    desktop would be seen. </p>

                <p align="justify">In the present day, people tend to use word processors like Microsoft Word, Google
                    docs
                    to conveniently tend on drafting documents, letters while decreasing the time consumption, but
                    increasing efficiency and productivity. In past accountants used typewriters to wrote letters. Main
                    disadvantage in this is, if you want to make changes or resurrection to the typed letter then you
                    have
                    to retype it from the beginning. However, this machine has replaced with the computer. Thus it
                    enables
                    people to make changes to their letters efficiently. </p>

                <p align="justify">There are many jobs roles being created because applications like spreadsheets, word
                    processing are being used for data analyzing and modelling process in almost every company. In
                    banks,
                    there are specialist ICT teams to maintain databases and networks. as a result, a wide range of jobs
                    is
                    available for the people. </p>

                <p align="justify">But in other side, old employments donâ€™t have good knowledge of computers thus they
                    may
                    be replaced with qualified ICT employment. Therefore, it may lose some amount of jobs from the
                    people
                    who have traditional office skills. In some industries, they replaced a huge number of factory
                    labours
                    with high technological robots. </p>
