                <p align="justify">When talking about leisure and entertainment it is must to be talk about video
                    gaming. In
                    the current society most of the people prefer to play games using Laptops, PlayStation and even
                    smartphones. However it provide some kind of an exercise to the users but it’s not good at all the
                    time.
                    when reflecting to previous years’ people went to play grounds and played physically with others.
                    But in
                    current society majority of teenager are stepped away from physical sports and tend to play computer
                    games continuously.

                </p>

                <p align="justify">Video gaming is very attractive because I was also played many games in the last two
                    years but it’s not good because it causes many health problems for me. I have better knowledge about
                    gaming and how to use it perfectly because it had affected me in many ways. However, gaming helps us
                    to
                    make decisions quickly in the real world. Now there are many video games available for many devices
                    so
                    playing a game is not hard for anyone in this world. Therefore, this is a very good service for busy
                    people who don’t have time to visit playgrounds or Gymnasium to have exercises.

                </p>

                <p align="justify">In my conclusion gaming is not good for school students because the majority of
                    students
                    in my school playing computer games daily without studying or even taking their regular meals. some
                    of
                    them failed in their exams due to overtime gaming. However, gaming is expensive in sometimes because
                    some new games required good system requirements.
