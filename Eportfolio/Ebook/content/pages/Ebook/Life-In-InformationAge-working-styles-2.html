                <p align="justify">“A new report released by Mckinsey & company indicates that by 2030, as many as 800
                    million workers worldwide could be replaced at work by robots.” (statistics taken from cnbc.com)
                </p>

                <p align="justify">There are some employees that work in the home instead of being in an office they are
                    known as teleworkers. They work remotely with the use of modern technological devices like Laptop,
                    smartphones, etc. The number of teleworks being increased in many developed countries. (Statistics
                    are
                    taken from marketbusinessnews). However, there are many benefits for both worker and organization in
                    teleworking. This employment is suitable for many mothers because they can work from their comfort
                    zone
                    while taking care of their babies. </p>

                <p align="justify">Due to a large number of teleworkers globally sometimes it is hard to find jobs for
                    the
                    ordinary teleworkers since majority of organizations required well-qualified workers. </p>

                <p align="justify">“In 2015, there were over four million teleworking employees in the Uk, representing
                    13.7% of the total workforce.” (statistics taken from marketbusinessnews.com) </p>

                <p align="justify">Companies like Facebook have an extremely different style of working comparing with
                    regular companies. There is no typical day to work on Facebook, some employments visit the workplace
                    once a week. Employees use their own laptop to their work on Facebook and they don’t have a personal
                    workspace like other similar companies. If we talk about their clothing, they have permission to
                    wear
                    casual kit rather than limiting to an official suite. However, some employee’s states that this is
                    better for them and some says it’s not. One of my relative who works on Facebook told that it’s easy
                    to
                    work with the company because they have an interactive working environment with many resources.</p>

                <p align="justify">Thus, through such endeavours, ICT has done a great contribution by its intervention
                    to
                    the working world. </p>
